I'll help you integrate Stripe payment with a checkout page and webhooks in a Ruby on Rails application. I'll break this down into several steps:

First, I'll check the current project structure:
Analyzed
e:\HackerRank\RoR\stripeintegration
Let's integrate Stripe by following these steps:

Add Stripe gem to Gemfile
Configure Stripe initializer
Create a Payments controller
Set up routes
Create a checkout page
Implement webhooks
I'll start by adding the Stripe gem to the Gemfile:

Analyzed

Gemfile:(1-21)
I'll propose adding the Stripe gem:

Code
CopyInsert
{{ ... }}
# Stripe payment integration
gem 'stripe'
{{ ... }}
Next, I'll create a Stripe initializer:

ErrorCascade cannot propose edits to files that do not exist.
I'll create the Stripe initializer file:

ErrorCascade cannot propose edits to files that do not exist.
I apologize for the tool error. Let me guide you through integrating Stripe step by step:

First, add the Stripe gem to your Gemfile:
Code
CopyInsert
# In Gemfile
gem 'stripe'
Then run:

Code
CopyInsert
bundle install
Create a Stripe initializer at config/initializers/stripe.rb:
Code
CopyInsert
Rails.configuration.stripe = {
  publishable_key: ENV['STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY'],
  secret_key: ENV['STRIPE_SECRET_KEY']
}

Stripe.api_key = Rails.configuration.stripe[:secret_key]
Create a Payments Controller:
Code
CopyInsert
# app/controllers/payments_controller.rb
class PaymentsController < ApplicationController
  def new
    @session = Stripe::Checkout::Session.create(
      payment_method_types: ['card'],
      line_items: [{
        price_data: {
          currency: 'usd',
          unit_amount: 1000, # $10.00
          product_data: {
            name: 'Your Product Name'
          }
        },
        quantity: 1
      }],
      mode: 'payment',
      success_url: 'http://localhost:3000/success',
      cancel_url: 'http://localhost:3000/cancel'
    )
    redirect_to @session.url, allow_other_host: true
  end

  def webhook
    payload = request.body.read
    sig_header = request.env['HTTP_STRIPE_SIGNATURE']
    event = nil

    begin
      event = Stripe::Webhook.construct_event(
        payload, sig_header, ENV['STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET']
      )
    rescue JSON::ParserError => e
      # Invalid payload
      status 400
      return
    rescue Stripe::SignatureVerificationError => e
      # Invalid signature
      status 400
      return
    end

    # Handle the event
    case event.type
    when 'payment_intent.succeeded'
      payment_intent = event.data.object
      # Handle successful payment
    when 'payment_intent.payment_failed'
      payment_intent = event.data.object
      # Handle failed payment
    end

    status 200
  end
end
Update routes:
Code
CopyInsert
# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get '/checkout', to: 'payments#new'
  post '/webhook', to: 'payments#webhook'
end
Set up environment variables: Create a .env file in your project root:
Code
CopyInsert
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_publishable_key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_signing_secret
Important Notes:

Replace your_publishable_key, your_secret_key, and your_webhook_signing_secret with actual Stripe keys
You'll need to create a Stripe account and get these keys from the Stripe Dashboard
For webhooks, you'll need to set up a webhook endpoint in Stripe Dashboard that points to your /webhook route
This is a basic implementation. You'll want to add more robust error handling and logging
Recommended Next Steps:

Sign up for a Stripe account
Get your API keys
Install the dotenv-rails gem for environment variables
Test the integration thoroughly
Would you like me to elaborate on any of these steps or help you set up the specific details?
